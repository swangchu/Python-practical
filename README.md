List of practical to help the beginners in learning python.

**List of projects to be implemented using Turtle Module** 

1. Write a program using Turtle module to generate a coil using six circles of radius 50 pixels and they are 20 pixels apath.
   
   **Turtle Methods Use**
   - **forward** : https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.forward
   - **circle**  : https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.circle
   
2.  Write a program using Turtle module to generate five dash lines starting 400 pixels from left of the center of the canvas and each dash to be 100 pixels and they are 100 pixels apath.
    
    **Turtle Methods which are not covered before**
     - **penup**   : https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.penup
     - **pendown** : https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.pendown

3. Write a program using Turtle module to generate a square of 100 pixels
   
   **Turtle Methods which are not covered before**
     - **left**  : https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.left
     - **right** : https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.right
     
 4. Write a program using Turtle module to generate a chain of 4 circles of radius 25 pixels.The circles just touches eachother and their outline to be of black,    yellow, red, green and blue.
    
    **Turtle Methods which are not covered before**
     - **color**     : https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.color
     - **pencolor**  : https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.pencolor
     - **fillcolor** : https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.fillcolor
 
 5. Write a program using Turtle module to generate a hexagon.Each side of the hexagon should of different color and thinkcer than then default size.Draw the hexagon with speed of 5.
 
     **Turtle Methods which are not covered before**
     - **pensize**  : https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.pensize
     - **speed** : https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.speed

6. Write a program using Turtle module to generate two concentric circles.The inner circle filled with red color while outer circle is without color.
   
      **Turtle Methods which are not covered before**
     - **begin_fill**  : https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.begin_fill
     - **end_fill** : https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.end_fill
     - **setposition** : https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.setposition
7. Write a program using Turtle module to generate series of shapes in line.Begin with a triangle then pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, octagon, nonagon and decagon.

      **Turtle Methods which are not covered before**
     - **circle**  : https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.circle
   
8.  Write a program using Turtle module to generate four circles.These circles just touches eachother and the center of the canvas is the center of all the circles.
9.  Write a program using Turtle module to generate a square swirl.
10.
